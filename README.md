## Project Description
This project involves the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) game using Tkinter in Python. The game will incorporate an online Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to navigate a maze-like environment, finding a path from a designated starting house to a goal house. By combining interactive gameplay with algorithmic pathfinding, the project aims to provide an engaging and educational experience for users.

## Game Features
The GUI game will feature a visually appealing interface where users can control a character or object within a maze. The objective of the game will be to guide the character from a predefined starting house to a goal house, overcoming obstacles and challenges along the way. Users will interact with the game environment through intuitive controls provided by the Tkinter GUI framework.

## Algorithm Integration
The project will integrate an online DFS algorithm to autonomously find a path from the starting house to the goal house within the game environment.
